Q. Can you explain Java Generics?
A. Java Generics is a feature that allows you to define classes or methods without specifying the data type upfront. Instead, you can specify the type when you actually use it. This is really helpful because it enhances code reusability and  ensures type safety at compile time.

Generics are closely related to data structures. For instance, Java's List, Set and Map classes are designed to handle various types of data using Generics.

Now, when we talk about a Set, which is a collection of unique elements, applying Generics allows us to clearly define what type of elements can be stored in that Set. For example, if you want a Set that only holds Strings, you would create it like this: Set<String> mySet.

You might wonder why we can't just use Object to store any type of data.
Well, if you do that, when you retrieve the data, it comes out as an Object, and you have to cast it to the specific type you need. This can lead to runtime errors if the type doesn't match.
So, using Generics helps avoid these issues by ensuring the only the specified type can be stored, eliminating the need for casting.

In summary, Java Generics is a powerful feature that improves code safety and reusability, making it easier to work with different data types without running into type-related problems.
